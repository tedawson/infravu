InfraVU is a project of the Vanderbilt Center for Digital Humanities that seeks
to create immersive experiences of parts of Vanderbilt normally hidden from most community
members, from servers to waste dumps. We post our results as 3D videos embedded in informational
blog posts on this site, and host launch parties for each of our new explorations at
the DH Center in Buttrick.
