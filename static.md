title: Why Static?

This is a static site. That means when your computer requests it, you get a plain HTML file, and that's all there is to it. Many sites these days are dynamic. This means the site is actually based on a database, and when you request a specific page, that page is built from the database just for you. Cool as this sounds -- and necessary as it is for sites like Amazon.com -- for a site like this one,  it means a lot of unnecessary data, a lot of unnecessary processing of that data, and a lot of wasted energy. For us, making this a static site is about conservation of resources, and it is about [minimal computing](http://go-dh.github.io/mincomp/about/). In other words, it is about the activist bent we can't hide from this project: yes, we want to reveal hidden infrastructure, and a big reason for doing that is to draw attention to the amount of infrastructure we depend on all the time for even the simplest tasks, with an eye to encouraging people to think about ways of reducing that infrastructure use. And that sort of thinking is built into this project from its inception. And that's why the page you are looking at is static.
